WP Plugin for Gramps

I wanted to show a Gramps Narrated Website within an iFrame initially but ran up against all sorts of issues when I tried to translate it into different languages.

https://www.rosentreter.website is where it is currently.

I'm not sure how to approach this as there a many possible solutions...


My thinking is to have the plugin upload the Narrated Website output file and store them in a separate folder.
